Javascript d3 homework

# Note
Probably treat this homework as the basic version (static graph).
It has most of the functionality for the advanced version, but I wasn't able to make the state abbreviations move along with the circles, so clicking on another axis will move the circles (and tooltips) but it won't change the position of the text within the circles.
